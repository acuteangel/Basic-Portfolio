# Basic-Portfolio
For my header I used a grid format to properly space my name and the navigation links. I had already learned this through freeCodeCamp prior to us learning about it in class. I used this because it seemed like the easiest way to position the header with css.

For my portfolio I used semi-transparent black bars with teal text as opposed to teal bars with white text.  I made this decision simply because it worked better visually with the placeholder images I had chosen.

My CSS is sorted by element, prioritizing Sectioning, followed by headings, media, forms, phrasing, miscellaneous(hr), class, then id.
